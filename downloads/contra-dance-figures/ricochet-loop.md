# Ricochet loop

What happens when a ricochet hey has so many ricochets that it's no longer a hey, so everyone stays on their side of the set. Dancers walk the same track as the end of a hey. Whenever they reach the center, they rebound off a dancer on the other side by raising two hands, pivoting, and pushing back.
