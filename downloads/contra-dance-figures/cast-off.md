# Cast off

Often the final move of the traditional "ones lead down; turn alone; return; cast off." This is unassisted (ones peel down the outside into second place, twos lead up to progress), or assisted (when ones step between the twos, all face up, put arms on your nearest neighbor's back, and with ones moving forward, twos backing up, turn as couples until all are facing across.)
