  <h2>Appendix B </h2>
  <h3 align="left">CONTRA DANCE FIGURES</h3>
  <p><em>Allemande left (right)</em>: Two dancers take left (right) hands and walk around  one another, pulling slightly on one another's arms to facilitate the turn. The  grip is not the one we use to shake hands, but is a grip with the thumb  pointing upward, with which it is possible to exert tension more effectively.  "Once around" means that the dancers walk completely around one  another and back to where they started. Fractional turns are measured in  relation to this. A <em>handy hand</em> allemande means that as one couple goes between the other, they allemande with  the nearest hand, the dancers on one side of the set using the opposite hand  from the dancers on the other side of the set:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig29" id="fig29"></a><img width="284" height="177" src="./cdss_files/fig-029.gif"><br>
    Figure 29. The  Allemande </p>
  <p><em>Balance</em>: The balance has many variations, but the most common one is a move  performed by stepping on the left foot and kicking up the right (or vice  versa), and then stepping on the right foot and kicking up the left (or vice  versa), in a four count sequence. The balance is found in three settings in  contra dance: two dancers may take one hand or both and balance facing one  another, usually preceding a swing; four dancers may take hands in a circle and  balance together; or four dancers may take hands in a wavy line (adjacent  dancers facing opposite ways) and balance together:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig30" id="fig30"></a><img width="298" height="243" src="./cdss_files/fig-030.gif"><br>
    Figure 30. The  Balance </p>
  <p><em>Box the gnat</em>: This is a figure borrowed from western square dance, and is a means by  which two dancers change places. The two dancers face one another and take  right hands; the woman turns and backs under the man's right arm while the man  crosses to her place, turning to face back the way he came; the dancers end the  move each occupying the original place of the other:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig31" id="fig31"></a><img width="298" height="80" src="./cdss_files/fig-031.gif"><br>
    Figure 31. Box  the Gnat </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>California</em><em> twirl</em>: This figure is similar to "box the gnat" in that two dancers  use it to change places. But it is different in that the dancers begin and end  the move standing side by side instead of facing one another, and the man takes  the woman's left hand in his right. The woman walks under the arch made by  their joined hands, while the man walks around her to his right to change  places, with the end result that the dancers are still side by side, but facing  the opposite way (<em>Country Dance and Song  Society Newsletter</em> 95 [1990]:8):</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

    Figure 32. California Twirl </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Cast off (or around)</em>: The cast off is a figure commonly used to accomplish the progression in a  contra dance, especially in the more traditional dances. Actives couples stand  between the inactives and either take inside hands or put their nearest arms  around these inactives, and turn with them, ending up below the inactives in  the set. Casting <em>around</em> another  couple generally means that the actives turn to the outside of the set and walk  out and around the inactives:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

    Figure 33.  Cast Off and Cast Around </p>
  <p><em>Circle left (right)</em>: Four dancers (or six in triple formation) take hands in a circle and walk  to the left (right) one full turn and back to place. Fractional circles involve  turns of more or less than one full turn: </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig34" id="fig34"></a><img width="274" height="174" src="./cdss_files/fig-034.gif"><br>
    Figure  34. The  Circle </p>
  <p><em>Contra corners</em>: Contra corners is a traditional figure in which the active couple  performs a series of allemandes with the couples on either side of them, and  with each other. To begin contra corners the active couple allemandes right  with each other in the center of the set, and then each of them allemandes left  with the person across the set to their right diagonal; the actives then return  to the center and allemande right with each other again, and then allemande  left with the person across the set and to their left diagonal. (Note that each  inactive person is turned by two different active dancers, one from each side.)  This completes the contra corners, and the active couple will usually come  together again in some fashion as they finish the figure:</p>

    Figure 35.  Contra Corners </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Courtesy turn</em>: The courtesy turn is a way in which a couple turns around halfway,  usually following a half ladies chain or a half right and left through. The man  takes the woman's left hand in his own left hand and places his right arm  around her waist, taking her right hand at the right side of her waist. In this  position the couple turns together one hundred and eighty degrees. Today's  contra dancers often dispense with the courtesy turn and accomplish the turn  with a twirl instead (see "twirl"):</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig36" id="fig36"></a><img width="266" height="203" src="./cdss_files/fig-036.gif"><br>
    Figure 36. The  Courtesy Turn </p>
  <p><em>Dosido</em>: The basic dosido figure is executed by two dancers who pass right  shoulders with one another, pass back to back, and back up passing left  shoulders and returning to place. A mirror dosido is one in which the dancers  on one side of the set begin the dosido passing right shoulders, and the  dancers on the other side of the set begin the dosido passing left shoulders. In  modern contra dance choreography it is common to do a "dosido once and a  half," which means that the dancers complete the basic dosido figure and  then pass right shoulders again, moving past one another, often to swing  someone else. Many of today's contra dancers like to twirl themselves around as  they do the dosido: </p>

    Figure  37. The  Dosido </p>
  <p><em>Down the center and back</em>: Active couples go down the center and back while the  other dancers watch. The dancers may turn individually before returning up the  hall, or they may turn as a couple. The caller will usually specify which way  to turn, since the method of turning affects the dancers' positions for the  next figure: </p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig38" id="fig38"></a><img width="347" height="179" src="./cdss_files/fig-038.gif"><br>
    Figure  38.  Down the Center and Back </p>
  <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
  <p><em>Down the outside and back</em>: This figure is traditionally performed by the active  couples, who turn away from the center of the set and walk down the outside of  the set, and then turn and come back to place:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig39" id="fig39"></a><img width="254" height="199" src="./cdss_files/fig-039.gif"><br>
    Figure  39.  Down the Outside and Back </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Down the hall four in line</em>: The four dancers in a minor set all walk down the  hall together in a line of four. Usually the active couple is in the middle,  but not necessarily. The caller will specify whether the four dancers should  turn individually or as couples before coming back up the hall, since the  method of turning affects their positions for the next figure:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig40" id="fig40"></a><img width="306" height="145" src="./cdss_files/fig-040.gif"><br>
    Figure 40.  Down the Hall Four in Line and Back </p>
  <p><em>Figure eight</em>: This figure is usually executed by the active couples around the inactive  couples. While the inactives stand still, the actives walk around them in a  figure eight pattern. Both a whole figure eight and a half figure eight are  common in contra dances. Often the inactives will move slightly to facilitate  the movement of the actives:</p>

    Figure 41. The  Figure Eight </p>
  <p><em>Four-leaf clover</em>: This figure is from square dancing, and is performed by four dancers. It  begins with dancers taking hands in a circle. Two dancers walk under the arch  made by the joined hands of the other two, and then turn back to back bringing  their own joined hands over their heads and into the center of the circle:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig42" id="fig42"></a><img width="288" height="227" src="./cdss_files/fig-042.gif"><br>
    Figure  42. The  Four-Leaf Clover </p>
  <p><em>Grand right and left</em>: This figure is used only rarely in contra dance, and is from the square  dance tradition. In a contra dance it is usually executed around the large  circle formed by the two sides of the set, joined at each end. Dancers walk  around the circle taking right hands and then left hands alternately with  successive dancers as they pass:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig43" id="fig43"></a><img width="271" height="227" src="./cdss_files/fig-043.gif"><br>
    Figure 43. The  Grand Right and Left </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Gypsy</em>:  The gypsy is a figure borrowed from English country dance. It is done by two  dancers, and may be done either to the right or to the left. The two dancers  circle, facing one another and without touching one another, and eye contact is maintained  continuously:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig44" id="fig44"></a><img width="106" height="94" src="./cdss_files/fig-044.gif"><br>
    Figure 44. The  Gypsy </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Hey for four</em>: This weaving figure has been borrowed from English country dance and is  now quite popular in contra dances. Four dancers weave around one another  without touching. Two dancers begin the figure by passing right (or sometimes  left) shoulders, and the dancers continue to pass right shoulders in the center  of the set and left shoulders at the sides (or vice versa) until they have  returned to place. Some new dances include fractions of heys, and also heys on  the diagonal. The contra dance hey differs from the English country dance hey  in that it is done in a smaller space and does not have the expansive elegance  given to it in the English country dance tradition:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig45" id="fig45"></a><img width="293" height="169" src="./cdss_files/fig-045.gif"><br>
    Figure45. The  Hey for Four </p>
  <p><em>Ladies chain</em>: The two women take right hands and cross the set, where they are turned  with a courtesy turn by the man on the opposite side. The women then take right  hands again and cross back to place, where they are once again turned, this  time by the man on their original side. This figure is often performed only half  way (across the set) without the return. Many of today's dancers like to use  twirls in place of the courtesy turns. There are newly composed dances that  include chains for the men instead of the women:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig46" id="fig46"></a><img width="295" height="146" src="./cdss_files/fig-046.gif"><br>
    Figure  46. The  Ladies Chain </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Long lines forward and back</em>: Dancers take hands along the sides of the sets, and  the two long lines walk four steps toward each other, and then four steps  backwards to place:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig47" id="fig47"></a><img width="251" height="205" src="./cdss_files/fig-047.gif"><br>
    Figure  47.  Long Lines Forward and Back </p>
  <p><em>Pass through</em>: This figure is performed by two couples who pass by one another as they  walk in opposite directions. The dancers on the right (usually the women) walk  in between the dancers approaching. This figure may be done up or down the set  or it may be done across the set:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig48" id="fig48"></a><img width="218" height="190" src="./cdss_files/fig-048.gif"><br>
    <a name="_Toc195457111" id="_Toc195457111">Figure </a>48. The  Pass Through </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Promenade</em>: The two couples in the minor set walk across the set in promenade  position passing one another, and then turn into the place vacated by the other  couple. The promenade hold varies regionally:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig49" id="fig49"></a><img width="254" height="204" src="./cdss_files/fig-049.gif"><br>
    Figure 49. The  Promenade Across </p>
  <p><em>Pull by</em>: Two dancers take hands and pull by one another going opposite directions.  This figure may use the right hand or the left hand depending on its context,  and it may occur along the set or across the set: </p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig50" id="fig50"></a><img width="187" height="124" src="./cdss_files/fig-050.gif"><br>
    Figure 50. The  Pull By </p>
  <p><em>Right and left through</em>: Two dancers on one side of the set change places  with two dancers on the other side of the set by passing through (passing right  shoulders with the dancer directly opposite) to the other side, and doing a  courtesy turn; then in like manner the two dancers pass through again and  return home to another courtesy turn. The "right and left through" is  often done only halfway, without the return:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig51" id="fig51"></a><img width="239" height="171" src="./cdss_files/fig-051.gif"><br>
    Figure 51. The  Right and Left Through </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Slide</em>:&nbsp; This term simply refers to a movement to the  right or left, usually no more than one or two steps. One common use of the  slide is in the balance in a wavy line, when after one balance the dancers  slide one place further down the line and balance again. Another common use is  when a couple moves together down the side of the set to circle with a new  couple:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig52" id="fig52"></a><img width="310" height="221" src="./cdss_files/fig-052.gif"><br>
    Figure 52. Two  Kinds of Slides </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Star</em>:  The star left (right) is performed by four dancers, who place their left  (right) hands together in the center of their little circle and walk around  counter-clockwise (clockwise). The hand hold used will vary regionally, the  most common holds being the handshake hold with the person opposite in the  star, and the wrist hold in which every dancer takes the wrist of the dancer  ahead. To star once around brings one back to where one started. Fractional  stars are also used in contra dance:</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig53" id="fig53"></a><img width="224" height="128" src="./cdss_files/fig-053.gif"><br>
    Figure  53. The  Star </p>
  <p><em>Swing</em>:  The swing is performed by two dancers, who most commonly hold one another in  ballroom position (the woman's left hand behind the man's upper right arm, and  his right hand on her lower back, their other hands joined), and turn clockwise  together. A walking step may be used with the swing, but the buzz step is more  popular in modern contra dance. The buzz step is a scooting motion in which the  dancers' right feet stay close to their center of gravity, while their left  feet scoot them around in a tight circle. Dancers lean back slightly as they  swing, "giving weight" (see Dancing Style below).  There are alternate holds for the swing, particularly for same-gender swings.  When a man and a woman swing, the swing ends with the woman standing to the  right of the man:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="fig54" id="fig54"></a><img width="283" height="132" src="./cdss_files/fig-054.gif"><br>
    Figure  54. The  Buzz Step Swing </p>
  <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
  <p><em>Twirl</em>:  The twirl is not a contra dance figure, but it is a popular variation used in  place of the courtesy turn in the ladies chain figure. Instead of the man  putting his right arm around the woman and turning around with her, he takes  her left hand in his and she turns clockwise under his raised left arm,  revolving one or more times, while he turns counter-clockwise in place, guiding  her all the way around him and facing her as she goes. Another kind of  "twirl" happens when dancers turn themselves around solo as they  execute a dosido or a hey for four:</p>
