# Swing

*From "Contra Dance Choreography" by Mary McNab Dart, Appendix B*

**Swing:** The swing is performed by two dancers, who most commonly hold one another in ballroom position (the woman's left hand behind the man's upper right arm, and his right hand on her lower back, their other hands joined), and turn clockwise together. A walking step may be used with the swing, but the buzz step is more popular in modern contra dance. The buzz step is a scooting motion in which the dancers' right feet stay close to their center of gravity, while their left feet scoot them around in a tight circle. Dancers lean back slightly as they swing, "giving weight" (see Dancing Style below). There are alternate holds for the swing, particularly for same-gender swings. When a man and a woman swing, the swing ends with the woman standing to the right of the man.
