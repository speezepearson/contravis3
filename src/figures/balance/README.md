# Balance

*From "Contra Dance Choreography" by Mary McNab Dart, Appendix B*

**Balance:** The balance has many variations, but the most common one is a move performed by stepping on the left foot and kicking up the right (or vice versa), and then stepping on the right foot and kicking up the left (or vice versa), in a four count sequence. The balance is found in three settings in contra dance: two dancers may take one hand or both and balance facing one another, usually preceding a swing; four dancers may take hands in a circle and balance together; or four dancers may take hands in a wavy line (adjacent dancers facing opposite ways) and balance together.
